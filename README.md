**Plupdate** is a [**Playdate**](https://play.date) **toybox** which helps manage the `playdate.update()` callback method.

You can add it to your **Playdate** project by installing [**toybox.py**](https://toyboxpy.io), going to your project folder in a Terminal window and typing:

```console
toybox add DidierMalenfant/Plupdate
toybox update
```

Then, if your code is in the `source` folder, just import the following:

```lua
import '../toyboxes/toyboxes.lua'
```

This **toybox** contains **Lua** toys for you to play with.

## Changes in your code

When using **Plupdate** or if you are using a library which uses **Plupdate**, make sure to replace your own `playdate.update()` like this:

```lua
Plupdate.addCallback(function()
    -- Place your update() code here instead
    ...
end)
```

Finally, if your `update()`` code was originally calling the following methods, replace them by the following ones in your app's initialisation instead:

```Lua
playdate.timer.update_timers()      ->  Plupdate.iWillBeUsingTimers()
playdate.frameTimer.update_timers() ->  Plupdate.iWillBeUsingFrameTimers()
playdate.graphics.sprite.update()   ->  Plupdate.iWillBeUsingSprites()
```

## Why do we need this?

Up to now, the main application had to implement `playdate.update()` and had to made sure that this method called all the update methods required by any dependencies. **Plupdate** handles this for you and also handles enabling updates for various SDK sub-systems like sprites or timers.

If you are using a library that means you don't have to worry about adding things to `playdate.update()` yourself. If you are writing a library that means you can make sure that the things you need are in `playdate.update()` without requiring anything from your end-user.

It just worksâ„¢.

## Usage

##### `Plupdate.iWillBeUsingTimers()`

Tell **Plupdate** that you require `playdate.timer.update_timers()` to be called during the update loop.

##### `Plupdate.iWillBeUsingFrameTimers()`

Tell **Plupdate** that you require `playdate.frameTimer.update_timers()` to be called during the update loop.

##### `Plupdate.iWillBeUsingSprites()`

Tell **Plupdate** that you require `playdate.graphics.sprite.update()` to be called during the update loop.

##### `Plupdate.showCrankIndicator()`

Displays the crank indicator as long as this is called every frame. This can be called from anywhere in your code, even a sprite `update()` method.

##### `Plupdate.addCallback(callback, arg1, arg2)`

Add a callback to the update loop. These will be executed **before** any of the system updates, sprites and timers for example, and in the order in which they are added.

In order to add an instance method as a callback, just pass `self` as the first argument:

```lua
Plupdate.addCallback(ClassName.method, self)
```

##### `Plupdate.addPostCallback(callback, arg1, arg2)`

Add a callback to the update loop. These will be executed **after** any of the system updates, sprites and timers for example, and in the reverse order in which they are added.

In order to add an instance method as a callback, just pass `self` as the first argument:

```lua
Plupdate.addPostCallback(ClassName.method, self)
```
